## 10/30/2025 - Started Placing Components  

*This is my first hardware project, so I'm starting out basic.*

Created an EasyEDA account and created a project. I started out by placing three components, and will continue later.
The three components I placed so far are:
1. C46749 (this is the 555 IC)
2. C32710674 (this is the main 4017 IC. It controls all of the LEDâ€™s flashing given an input from the 555)
3. C492401 (this is the header, or little pins which will be used to power the circuit)
